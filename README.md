# My Personal Project

##Motivation for the Project:
*My idea for my personal project is something that emulates the functionalities of existing menstrual cycle apps.
By recording the days that they are menstruating, women can keep track of their health through the patterns they
observe in the days they track. The menstruation cycle is an important indicator for many aspects of women's health. I
personally thought it would be interesting to construct one myself because of its calendar-like and journal-like 
functionalities as well as the fact that I personally use similar applications, which has offered me greater insight 
into my health. For example, many young women experience anemia as a result of their heavy periods and apps like these
helps them to better understand their experiences.*
